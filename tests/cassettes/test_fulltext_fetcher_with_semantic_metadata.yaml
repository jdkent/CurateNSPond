        of Nano Leo, a prosexual nutrient formulation, on libido, erection, and orgasm
        in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Methods This was a prospective,
        single-center, phase IV efficacy study. Patients received two capsules for
        7 days and thereafter one capsule through 90 days. Main outcome measures:
        primary endpoint was change in erectile function assessed using the International
        Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Secondary endpoints included
        improvement in testosterone levels, FSH, LH, and prolactin levels; seminal
        parameters; and overall quality of life (QoL). Results Our study included
        99 men (mean age 32.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.71 years). Mean erectile function
        domain score increased from 18.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.67 at baseline to 23.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.01
        on day 90 (P < 0.001). Similar improvements were observed in orgasmic function,
        sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction domains
        of IIEF score which was seen as early as day 30. Improved IIEF corroborated
        with improvement in all QoL domains. From baseline to day 90, treatment with
        Nano Leo increased testosterone levels (5.04\u2009\u00b1\u20092.22 vs. 5.57\u2009\u00b1\u20091.53\u2009ng/mL,
        P < 0.001). Similar improvements were observed in orgasmic function, sexual
        desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction domains of IIEF
        score which was seen as early as day 30. Improved IIEF corroborated with improvement
        in all QoL domains. From baseline to day 90, treatment with Nano Leo increased
        testosterone levels (5.04\u2009\u00b1\u20092.22 vs. 5.57\u2009\u00b1\u20091.53\u2009ng/mL,
        Conclusion Nano Leo showed improved libido, erection, and orgasm as evaluated
        by IIEF and QoL and was well tolerated. Therefore, Nano Leo could be an effective
        and safe pronutrient supplement in managing ED."}
